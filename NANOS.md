# NANOS support (experimental)

[Nanos](https://github.com/nanovms/nanos) is a "new kernel designed to run one and only one application in a virtualized environment." See the config file `nanos.json` and replace the hypervisor if you don't have Hyper-V on your system. See `nanos.sh` for how to run the app with `ops` and `nanos`.
