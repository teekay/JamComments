# Running JamComments on the Azure cloud

The admin app can run as a Web app on the App Service PaaS. If you are operating it yourself for your web properties, you can turn it on and off as you need it (or don't).

The comments API can run on Azure Functions. The Consumption tier is totally fine for self-hosting scenarios. The first request is going to tak a few seconds and the subsequent requests run just fine.

## ZIP deploy

Deploy function app:

```sh
yarn build
zip -r app.zip . -x@.funcignore -x .funcignore

```
